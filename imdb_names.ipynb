After the marriage their life is virtually perfect. Then one day, Jalandhar gets a visit from a Sage who tells him that there is war going between the Devas (Gods) and Danavs (Demons), and that Bhagwan Vishnu has been siding with the Devas. Curious to find out more, Jalandhar journeys to his father, Sagar (Ocean), who tells that he had attempted to make peace between the Devas and the Danavs by offering them sweet nectar of life, but Bhagwan Vishnu had taken the shape of a beautiful woman, Mohini, and made sure that only the Devas got the nectar. Jalandhar is angered at this, and declares war against Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas. Vrunda begs him not to go, as Vishnu is all powerful. When he insists on going, she prays to the Gods and puts a flowered garland (full of blessings) around his neck to ensure his safety. Jalandhar defeats Indra Dev and comes home victorious, along with Indraloks apsaras (beautiful women) and Indrani herself. The enraged Devas appeal to Bhagwan Vishnu, who agrees to do battle with Jalandhar, but again Jalandhar triumphs, and thus becomes Bhagwan Jalandhar. The worried Devas approach Bhagwan Shiv, who refuses to get involved in any war with anyone. In the meantime, Jalandhar gets angry with Vrunda for worshiping Vishnu and cuts her tongue off so as to prevent her from praying. She goes to pray to Vishnu, and he reinstates her tongue. This angers Jalandhar all the more, and in penance Vrunda blinds herself, and is placed in a dungeon surrounded by a wall of fire. Jalandhar now wants the most beautiful woman in the world, and he is told that there is no one more beautiful than Bhagwan Shiva's wife, Parvati. He accordingly sends word for Parvati to come to him. This angers Shiv and he goes to battle Jalandhar. Once again Jalandhar triumphs, and is all set to have Parvati for his own. Parvati and the other Devas now approach Bhagwan Shri Brahma for a solution. In the meantime, Vrunda regains her eyesight, and to her delight finds that Jalandhar has changed, and they spend a lot of time together. Days later, the severed head of Jalandhar comes into their palace, and accuses Vrunda of infidelity. Vrunda is astounded as she has always been true to her husband, but then there was the severed head floating in the air, and there was her husband standing next to her. She soon finds out that the person standing next to her is Bhagwan Vishnu who had assumed the form of Jalandhar, the real Jalandhar had been defeated by Bhagwan Shiv in battle, and his head severed from his body. Now Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas have to content with Vrunda's wrath - and she wills Vishnu to become of stone for pulling wool over her eyes, and then she turns her wrath on the rest of the Devas. Will anyone or anything be able to stop Vrunda?\n",

      "Directed by B.R. Ishara, Ek Nazar is a poignant romantic drama that showcases the complexities of love, ambition, and sacrifice. Featuring the charismatic pair of Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri (later Jaya Bachchan), this film is a compelling watch for fans of classic Bollywood cinema. Plot Overview The story revolves around Rajesh (Amitabh Bachchan), a poet who finds himself captivated by Shabnam (Jaya Bhaduri), a courtesan with an enigmatic personality and a haunting past. Their relationship blossoms despite societal norms and their personal struggles. The film delves into themes of redemption, societal hypocrisy, and the power of love to transcend barriers. Performances Amitabh Bachchan, in one of his earlier roles, delivers a restrained and heartfelt performance as Rajesh. His portrayal of a tortured poet is convincing, hinting at the superstar he would later become. Jaya Bhaduri shines as Shabnam, bringing depth and vulnerability to her character. Her nuanced expressions and understated acting style perfectly complement Bachchan's intensity. Music The soulful music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, combined with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri, is one of the film's highlights. Songs like \"Patta Patta Boota Boota\" (sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi) remain timeless, beautifully reflecting the film's melancholic and romantic undertones. Overall, Ek Nazar is a classic that highlights the magic of early Bollywood romance with a touch of social commentary. The film is an ode to love's transformative power and the sacrifices it demands. While it may not be fast-paced, its poetic storytelling and soulful music make it a memorable experience for fans of vintage cinema.\n",

Raised under the tutelage of Brahma and sanctified by the water that had once washed the feet of Vishnu, Ganga becomes a celestial river coursing the heavens, purifying anything she touches. With Ganga guarding heaven's periphery, the defeated Paap turns his sight to earth. There he ravages the land and its inhabitants alike, until Ganga is besought to descend upon earth to wash away sin with her cleansing waters.\n",

But on this particular day, when Madan and his friends rise from their slumber, some with the customary hangover, they are not so perturbed to find no water in the taps again, as when they hear that it is not going to be a holiday after all. Instead there will be a lecture in the auditorium by the Chairman of the Board (Dr. Shriram Lagoo), on the day of the festival of fire, Holi, and the boys decide not to attend the classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some human links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student, in which the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated. It is an unjustifiably drastic punishment, and the news spreads like wildfire. Resistance is organized in the library, in the laboratory, in the classrooms and the college grounds. In the auditorium, the first egg hits the Chairman, and pandemonium follows. To save his own job, the principal decides to track down the culprits. Professor Singh politely refuses to help. The principal now blackmails one of the hostel boys, whose father he knows, and who is in any case a loner, and a butt of jokes in the campus. Imbued with a false sense of power, the boy walks into the principal's trap. A large group of boys, all from the hostel, are immediately rusticated, and asked to vacate their rooms by the morning. The boys, not all of them actually guilty of rebellion, are now all in a rage. They make a bonfire of the hostel furniture and their textbooks. Feeling impelled to share his sense of triumph, the informer confides in the boy whom he hates and fears the most, and whose name he has kept out of the list. As a result he is mercilessly humiliated by everyone, and just about manages to rush away from his tormentors and lock himself in his room. In the gathering dusk, the young rebels sit listlessly on the steps of the hostel, their anger giving way to depression, when one of them discovers the informer hanging from the fan in his room, quite dead. Madan and his friends confront faceless policemen who come to investigate the suicide. In the morning, the police van carrying the boys away, is caught in the midst of a rowdy, jostling crowd of merrymakers, playing with colours.

When that does not happen, Lilavati insists on seeing her photograph, so Sampat and Ravi select a random photo from a studio, make a copy, and show it to Lilavati. Shortly thereafter a woman resembling the one in the photo shows up at Ravi's doorstep claiming to be his wife, Urvashi.

One such story is of Mukhiya Hardayal, who is on the Panchayat, and is opposed to the cruel practices of Thakur Sher Bahadur Singh. When Hardayal's wife, Krishna, passes away while delivering their second son, Karamveer, he begins to hate, treat him contemptuously, generally ignore him and holds him responsible for his wife's death. Hardayal spends all his love for his elder son, Suraj, who does live up to his father's expectations and excel in his studies, so much so that the Thakur himself loans some money to Hardayal so that Suraj can further his studies in Bombay. After Suraj leaves, Hardayal finds himself enmeshed in the Thakur's loan, unable to re-pay it with the interest, he is severely whipped and made to work as a bonded laborer. Fifteen years later, the work and the beatings have taken their toll on Hardayal, and his spine is fractured beyond repair. Suraj returns home, finds the plight of his father, confronts Thakur, who in turn offers money so that Suraj can go abroad to further his studies. A grateful Hardayal accepts this offer - only to find out that this was another ploy of the wily Thakur to separate Suraj from his family, make Karamveer and Hardayal his laborers. Hardayal continues to work for the Thakur, hoping that one day Suraj will return and all his troubles will be over. What Hardayal does not know that Suraj may never return home, as he has been apprehended with smuggling drugs - and it looks like the Thakur will continue to have his way with Hardayal and the rest of the villagers.\n",

The film breaks generic conventions, notably in the presentation of the private detective through his deglamourised life and his process of discovery of 'who did it'. It is not constructed through his point of view at all. In fact the policeman and the detective, the fact finders, are in the dark about the crime, to the very end.\n",

Then one day he sees a beautiful young woman (Madhu) jogging, and decides to have her for himself at any cost. He starts stalking her, and even plants a wireless camera in her bedroom so as to spy on her. One day while following her, he accosts and confronts her and tells her of his love for her, but she rejects him and asks him to leave her alone. He refuses to listen, and tries to force himself upon her but she is saved with the timely arrival of her Police Inspector boyfriend, Vijay. Rajeshwar is arrested and held in prison, but is soon released when a high-priced lawyer is hired by Ajit. Vijay and Madhu hope that it is the last they have seen of Rajeshwar, and return to their romance. But Rajeshwar has not forgotten Madhu, nor of his humiliation at the hands of Vijay. He manages to follow Madhu, confronts her, and has his way with her, and leaves her for dead to carry on with his irresponsible lifestyle. When Vijay finds out that his sweetheart is dead, he is beyond himself and goes on the rampage, looking for Rajeshwar. Before Vijay could even trace him, Rajeshwar finds out that his friends, who had aided him against Madhu, are dying one by one. One is hit by a truck, the other is electrocuted in his bathtub, and a third falls from a cliff. What or who is killing these men, and is Rajeshwar going to be the next victim.

In January, 1990, the Kashmiri Pandits too were subject to the same indignity, not only at the hands of their own government, the mujahaideen extremists, their friends, and neigbors, but were also cast as \"refugees\" in their own country. This story revolves around resilient Pandit Amarnath who is the only Pandit who is refusing to leave Srinagar. He is compelled to do, after Muslim Jihaadis brutally kill his son, just a day after a U.S.-based \"Human Rights\" group concluded that there was no violence, and peace prevails in the Kashmir Valley, which is being over-run by Muslim extremists, who receive their \"training\" in Pakistan. Amarnath realizes that he has an uphill task for having his issues resolved with his very own Government, as well as the intenational community, that raises a hue and cry over the death of a 2 or 3 Americans, but puts up a wall of red tape and bureacracy when it comes to the death of citizens of another country.\n",

His failures have created a rift in his relationship with Meneka, his wife. While the marriage is not really on the rocks, Meneka does feel neglected and lonely. Her attempts at understanding Aditya are usually met with a snub. She misses the caring, loving and passionate Aditya for whom she had forfeited her successful modeling career. The arrival of a stranger, Shoaib, into the house soon turns into an exploration of morality and momentary temptation. The disarming, mysterious Shoaib opens up vistas that were till now taboo for Meneka. He charms her, he angers her and in the process he provokes her innermost thoughts and desires. Who is this dangerously charming stranger? Will his presence rock the very institution that Meneka has been clinging to? And what will Aditya who has been so engrossed in his own professional failures do when he realizes the deception that is about to engulf his personal life?\n",

Sunny also managed to bag a prestigious screenplay writing project for the most happening film director, Karan Johar. A bit of a cynic, he believes he is a self-made man and that whatever he has achieved in life is due to his own hard work and nobody else's. His cynicism is extended to his views about marriage to his fiancé Jenny (Ayesha Takia) and to the festival of Diwali too. Just as Sunny is cynical about life, Michael Burnett (Boman Irani) is optimistic about it. 51 year old Michael is a simple minded man, almost childlike and has recently landed job as a pizza delivery boy at Mummy's Pizza. Michael has sort of an inclination to lose every job he has ever had in 2 days flat. This time, however, he vows to keep this one no matter what. On the eve of Diwali, Sunny has loads of stuff to do and very little time to do it. He has to meet his screenplay deadline, he has to get rid of Pandey (Saurabh Shukla) his irritatingly intrusive next door neighbor and he's got to avoid his editor's telephone calls who is livid that he's bunking work. But more importantly he needs to get Jenny out of the way because he has a date with Maya (Mahima Chaudhary), a South Indian superstar who he has been in love with since as long as he can remember. In this confusion, Sunny forgets that there is no food in his bachelor pad and orders a pizza that Michael is given the task of delivering. And what Michael delivers to Sunny is so much more than just a pizza. Sunny is home delivered life's simple lessons right to his doorstep.\n",

Every parent prays to God that they be blessed with an intelligent and physically powerful male child and if it is a female child she be sanctified with divine beauty... This very benevolence of God becomes an inconceivable curse for some parent. This is precisely what happens to a haggard woman, Chanda, who works at a rustic brick kiln to meet her daily needs. Like every dutiful mother would protect her young child, Chanda has religiously rubbed the kiln-ash every day over her daughter's ever-glowing skin for past sixteen years in order to protect her honor from the lustful eyes of this world. Chanda appears as a model of a sanctimonious motherhood and stands out as a self-respectful & strongest mother. Unfortunately due to sickness of her husband she borrows money from the brick-contractor, Shambhu, and unwillingly enrolls herself amongst those underprivileged & helpless women who undergo physical abuse in return of his monitory favor whenever he wishes so. As a hard luck would have it, one day Shambhu's eyes glimmer to see the mouth-watering attractiveness of Chanda's daughter, Chakori whose beauty was hidden under the layers of murky ash for years. Overwhelmed by this cruel situation and sensing his wicked intent, Chanda finds no other solution to safeguard her daughter's honor but to marry her to an aged 55 yrs old, Ramkhilavan who perceives his wife as nothing but a mere commodity to fulfill his sexual desires. By nature, Chakori's husband, Ramkhilavan is a pervert old man who seems overjoyed to trap a young virgin in his marital snare. To his dismay on his first night, he discovers that his young wife knows nothing about sexual act. As a wise old man he makes a prudent decision not to ravage her chastity with force but to prepare her slowly into physical submission. However in the process, the old man realizes his cardinal sin and surrenders before her sacred innocence that ultimately transforms him from a depraved demon to a holy saint.\n",

This fusion of documentary and fiction narrative depicts the lives of foreign migrants as an impending water crisis begins to seep into their lives. With water, or the lack of it, becoming the central motif, this two-part feature length film takes us on a journey across 8 interweaved stories and 10 languages, as the protagonists, consisting of non-professional actors, grapple with this hopefully temporary discomfort, amidst their dalliance with human foibles, and their fantasies of everlasting loves and broken romances. This aberration is a memento mori as the narratives grazed across the vague impressions of the racial tensions lingering past the 1997 riots in Indonesia, World War II, ritual beliefs, and ethnic discrimination in Southeast Asia which has been ingrained over generations and transported along with the migrant communities. Nonetheless, amidst the sporadic ventures into death and violence, sexual relations and sexualities, these are the lines of division that bind us to each other, in one way or another, as people survive through their crises.\n",

His world revolves around a doting mother, a passion for music and the memories of a childhood friend, Sameer, who left Goa for Mumbai many years ago and hasn't replied to his frequent letters ever since. Pinto's talent for music is only matched by his knack for finding trouble in the unlikeliest of places often resulting in the most outlandish and hilarious situations. When Pinto's idyllic world is shattered by the sudden demise of his mother he decides to head to Mumbai in search of the only friend he knows. Will Pinto find Sameer or will trouble find him first? Will Pinto and his crazy antics survive the big bad city or more importantly, will Mumbai survive a phenomenon called Pinto?\n",

We are most afraid to believe in our own dreams. Those who do are the true winners. This slice of life film is set in the backdrop of our capital city- Delhi. A city that brings in thousands of North Indians in search of opportunities that was never available in their own home towns. Like-wise, six boys from different states come together to share a two BHK apartment in a middle-class colony, which they lovingly call \"Sadda Adda\". This film is their story. It is about how six bachelors, with completely different backgrounds and personalities, live together. Their apartment \"Sadda Adda\" is a complete mess with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, unwashed clothes, mattresses tossed all over the floor etc - yet together they cook food, clean, buy groceries, pay rent, laugh, cry, fight over insignificant issues and always stand up for each other - like a family. \"Sadda Adda\" which began as a transitional accommodation to help them work towards their dreams, becomes their home. The film takes us through a journey of their camaraderie and self-belief. The interwoven stories of these 6 characters takes us through a heart warming journey of the lives of these boys. This movie is about real characters from life who have fun, who fight the wave everyday and through very light heart moments inspire us in the most modest way. The crests and troughs that shape them into the men they will become in the future - because Boys will not always be boys.\n",

It was under the leadership of Gandhi ji that Naram Dal took on the Britishers and led a peaceful march towards independence. Lal Bahadur Shastri was a prominent personality in this group and has a huge role to play in the history of India's independence. However this dynamic leader had his own story to deal with during the initial phase of his life. A low economic background, untimely death of his father and a mother to look after...these were just some of the problems that gave Lal Bahadur Shashtri a direction in life. After completing his studies in Banaras, Shashtri ji came to Allahabad and that's when he witnessed a revolution in the country. Inspired to take part in the freedom fight, Lal Bahadur Shashtri now became an active freedom fighter and was sent to jail several times. But Lal Bahadur Shashtri's fight didn't end with achieving freedom for his motherland, it got extended to his role as India's prime minister too.

It had never been like that there, why, why here?\" so on and so forth. I need to tell her etiquette is different here. But how? Surveys, blogs, news papers, TV, Media conclude the rudeness is in every part of Indian life even in professional jobs. Everybody thinks that we are rude people. We behave like early man even after learning about behavioral science, social science, general science, civic science and what not, all basics of society rules for 15 to 16 years at school. The Times of India article suggested the survey is not in need, the news paper concluded \"Indians are rude, uncivil and thoughtless\". The Hindu article dated May 15, 2012 says \"junior doctors see their seniors - their so-called role models - being rude\". I wonder how we adopted this rudeness when our prayers \"Om Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah\" praying for everyone's happiness. As we all know, Parents serve as role models not only through direct interactions with their children, but through the examples they set with their attitude and behavior within the family and in the outside world. If we don't, our kids won't, their kids won't, behave well. We achieved sovereignty; dignity should be our new frontier for a better society, in fact for a better nation.\n",

With vulnerable youths falling for the stories of getting an opportunity to work for Allah and empowered with thoughts that your hands will kill the innocent but Allah will forgive all has given these youths the notion that all is fair on the course of Jihad. In the history of mankind, fanaticism has caused more harm than any vice. Despite a space of several years the wounds inflicted by the Indian army in Kashmir were still fresh in Altaaf's mind when he joined the terrorist outfit with the pious thoughts of wiping away the enemies of Islam. Little did he know that he had in turn, gullibly fallen into the trap of people with vested interest and crooked ideas. During one of his assignments Altaaf meets Bhavna, widow of a doctor they had once killed on the suspicion of being an informer of the army. Holed out at Bhavna's house, Altaaf undergoes a metamorphosis as he witnesses Bhavna's plight and helplessness. History however, is replete with the stories of Jihadis or the soldiers of the Holy War, who at some point during their fight for religion realize that they have taken an erroneous decision. Realize that bullets can win wars but not hearts and in the bargain comprehend that they are treading on a path of no return. Jihad is the journey of the militant Altaaf and his realization of the futility of his holy war as he stumbles upon a few truths. That unfortunately Jihad is generally misunderstood to be true Islam. Whereas Islam stands for humanity. Islam prevails amidst brotherhood of people. And Altaaf also learns the supreme truth. That the true meaning of Jihad is not the holy war outside but the war within. Jihad is nothing but overpowering your inner devil. Firearms can give death, not life. Impart life if you can..!!.

So, you have the lead character move away from the city following a bad break-up and then returning back after 3 years, a successful Business consultant/entrepreneur and feeling strong enough emotion for his former love that he donates a kidney to her ailing industrialist husband who could well have paid for it without maintaining a sweat. While the young actors at the centre of it all are pretty earnest with their expressions, they don't have the polish or the sharpness that finely defined performances could lend to this vacillating drama that shifts its focus from everyday office gossip and politics, target pressures and job promotions to convoluted romantic drama and faltering ambitions.\n",

Ironically, she lives in a house 'Utsab' (meaning Festival) but she is lonely, often lost in her thoughts. Music is her only companion since her daughter travels due to work assignments and stays in a different city. Daughter's home coming is always celebrated in Bengal, just like Durga Puja. So after years Suchitra leaves no stone unturned to welcome her daughter and her fiancee Usmaan. Over a five course Bengali meal and few glasses of wine, they discover each other. While Romita thought that she was the one waiting to surprise her mother with Usmaan's presence in her life, she didn't know that her mother had bigger surprises stored for her.\n",

After all, if the money of the public comes to the public then what is wrong. The plan of the five was successful and they managed to steal. But luck had something else approved.It seems that the number 8 is not a fate of his fate. The Prime Minister's announcement of demonetisation on November 8 at 8:00 pm changed all the fortunes. The money for which they were running back till today is trying to go far away from the same money today. It did not take so much effort to loot it, as it now took to hide it. It is so strange that if there is no money, there is trouble and if there is trouble. Where would the stolen money go after all this money was scrapped in demonetisation. One side leader fell behind them, and the other side luck did not take the name of ending the problems of theft on them, so the five together started saving lives. They began to start putting the stolen money at the right place. In the midst of bad luck, the five managed to get the money right, but the money does not reach the five. One of the friends who was orphan, would have deposited these money in orphanage house and some money reaches everyone but this part of the race behind the money has taught everyone a lesson that the money is necessary for life but not so much that one loses ones happiness behind it.

Mehtab has a customer(Kritika) for his cab, who works in a call center to whom he regularly picks and drops. One fine day, Kritika spots some of her friends who are involved in shooting from the cab while commuting to work, she suddenly asks Mehtab to stop the car, after which she goes out and meets them and comes back to the cab to go for work, which catches the attention of Mehtab. Exited, he instantly asks her about the work of her friends they are involved in. Kritika tells him, that her friends work for a social media platform, and they are getting great response for their videos, they shoot and post in the social media. Upon which Mehtab tells her, that his younger brother Wajid is also very active in social media and is looking for a relevant job. He(Mehtab) requests her if she can recommend his younger brother for a job there, to which she responds, she will ask her friends and will let him know. Eventually, Mehtab forwards a contact to Wajid and asks him to get in touch with them for job. Wajid goes and meets Mr. Ketan(Boss) for a job, who interviews him and eventually hires him. Wajid starts working for Ketan and they are involved in shooting prank videos with random citizens and make money out of it. Soon Wajid's work is appreciated by Ketan and he becomes the team lead of all the employees and also achieves good support from everyone. Ketan enjoys good success and revenue from the prank videos that his employees shoot, but he scarcely rewards them back for their hard work as he is a very greedy and selfish man. This earns him the displeasure of Wajid and all other employees. As a result, he promises them, he will give the credit to everyone, by adopting an independent way of working outside Ketan's knowledge. Meanwhile, Wajid's father and Mehtab watch the prank videos shot by Wajid and his team, and are not happy from his work, stating it to be immoral, to which Wajid responds by trying to clear the misconception to Mehtab. Whereas Sonal(Mehtab's girlfriend) is supportive of Wajid's initiatives and persuades Mehtab to support Wajid in his cause, but he disagrees with her in it.

One night, while Sonal and Mehtab are discussing about their future wedding, walking on a deserted road, a Car hits mehtab from back and disappears, leaving mehtab seriously wounded. A distressed Sonal after witnessing the horrific scene desperately cries for help, to which a passer by responds, they have witnessed some prank videos on this street before and this might well be a prank attempt to fool them, refuse to help her and leave. On the other side, Wajid is informed of Mehtab's accident over call and rushes to hospital to see Mehtab, where his entire family is present. After seeing him for a while, Wajid comes out of hospital room, where Sonal follows him and confronts Wajid furiously for his prank job, and blames him completely for the current situation of Mehtab, stating Mehtab was indeed right about him and she herself was wrong in supporting him earlier. As Wajid is broken from her fiery arrows of words, they both hear the call of heena, that Mehtab cant breath anymore. they both rush back to hospital and discover Mehtab is dead, leaving everyone grieving over it. Later, Wajid gets criticized by his father as well, which leaves him enraged and he furiously arrives at Ketan's office, and confronts him to stop the prank work forever, on which Ketan disagrees with him and orders him to leave, as a result it turns into a major fight between the two, leaving Ketan wounded. Wajid is handed over to police as an aftermath of it. Upon interrogation, initially he refuses to speak , but after being forced and threatened by officers, and he finally reveals the entire story to police. Upon learning about his story, police officers release him, after warning him.

      "Jealousy is a very much human emotion and astonishingly a highly contagious one too. A jealous mind can go to any length to scheme against those who are doing better. Dhananjay is a young unmarried IT professional. Sankraman or Infection is the story of Dhananjay who feels that destiny is cruel to him. He is convinced that every undeserving person around is on a mission to belittle him. While thinking about punishing those undeserving people he has created a dark room in his mind for himself. It is a world where he is the predator and those who mock him directly or indirectly are his prey. This day begins like any other day for Dhananjay, full of frustration and anguish. Because of his pessimistic thinking, Dhananjay sees everything as a chip on his shoulder. This frustration has led him to believe that nothing good will ever happen in his life. He imagines torturing his neighbour because he has a well settled family. Dhananjay lacks empathy and love in his life. Adding to the frustration and jealousy, a good looking female colleague tells Dhananjay about her wedding. Dhananjay looks at the photo of her fiance and jealousy again kicks in. But today is the day when the company is going to announce, \"Employee of the year\". This day is not at all going well for him. He's worried that he is going to lose yet again. Dhananjay believes he deserved to win the award last year and is the best candidate to win the award this year as well. Karan, who according to Dhananjay is a quintessential undeserving fellow, won this award last year. Dhananjay sees an archrival in Karan. In his pessimist mind Dhananjay is afraid that his destiny will betray him once again. But What if Dhananjay wins the award? Jealousy can be highly contagious. Now, Karan becomes jealous of Dhananjay. He is now infected with jealousy. Hence the Sankraman or infection is complete. Now, Karan will go through psychological nightmares because of this Sankraman till he passes it on to someone else. Or at least takes revenge from Dhananjay, the undeserving one according to Karan. Jealous Karan becomes owner of the imaginary dark room. Dhananjay is his first prey.\n",

When people saw her and called her by the name - \"Sophia\".It sounds strange to hear the name Apashguni, but the girl was smiling after hearing her new name, thinking that I had come to some paradise. But people are not even touching me, it feels like I have a disease. Those who came to celebrate also left. People wanted to kill me, thinking, 'I am a girl and what can I give except defamation?'The only person who was fully supporting me was my mother. I was dead in the eyes of the world, but I was in an orphanage. I had a full family, but still I was in an orphanage.There was not a single day when my mother didn't come to meet me and feed me milk. She used to take full care of me and lie to my mother and family that I was going to meet my friend. Every day my mother made new excuses.One day I had a high fever and that day my mother stayed with me all day and went back home after putting me to sleep. Dad asked how it was so late and she said that my friend was unwell and I was helping her. Dad also beat up mom that day in anger. My mother was in pain, but still hiding me, she thought I was a child, what would I understand, but it was not so, I understood everything.I also thought I'd be knowledgeable. I went to madam and on requesting a lot, she told me everything. Hearing all this, I got very angry, I thought that I have to do something different.When something grew up, I joined the boxing club. When I turned 18, I got the title of state champion. Two months later, I had a national match with a Pakistani girl. When the media came to interview me, I got a call from my mother and she said, 'Daughter, please don't harm your family.' I was laughing that my mother was still saving her family. I gave an interview and the whole public heard that interview on TV. In the evening, mom told that while watching TV, papa was saying that wow what a girl, how much name she is bringing to her parents and family.They had left me saying That I am Kulakshmi. Today they wanted to meet me and take photos with me but even today they were unaware of who I am.Exactly two months later, there was a National Championship match and they all came to see me. A lot of people had come to watch the match and everyone was saying - \"You can do it\" but my eyes were looking for my family in that crowd. When I saw my family in the distant crowd, I was angry and I vented all the anger on my opponent and won the national title.Then what, everyone became interested in me, people started asking me about my family. Very compelled, I told him that I was the girl who was killed 20 years ago who was first given the name \"sofia\". My whole family's eyes were moist.Just then someone came running from the distant crowd and called me a daughter, it was as if it was like a dream for me, the childhood love I had lost, I suddenly got it and she hugged me and said to everyone - \"This is my daughter\" who gave me the right to be a father.

Research was conducted because the human mind is capable of understanding the Supreme power, but due to short-term goals or distractions, our human generation all over the globe is not focusing on those things or not even trying. Research was conducted when we had free time last year, and we were trying to observe many things happening in our locality. Then we came to understand this concept, that a huge population on this planet is primarily concerned with their survival only. The first thing is that the human brain is very powerful. The second thing is that the brain operates in a loop. When we change the loop or thinking pattern, the whole situation changes. The third thing is that no one likes to make any kind of change because changes can be painful. The fourth thing is that there are entities handling our planet and our lives. The fifth thing is that there is a distinct pattern of life. Overall, the conclusion is, \"MRITYU BHI SATYA HAI, JIWAN BHI SATYA HAI, RAM NAAM SATYA HAI.\"\n",

The house is said to steal the childhood of any child who enters, yet the children venture inside, and emerge as adults. However, their newfound maturity is short-lived when they are attacked by a supposed ghost, revealing itself as a traumatized girl named Naina. The duo is unexpectedly tied to chairs, plunged into darkness, and introduced to Scienjo, a peculiar scientist and joker. Naina, haunted by childhood bullying, initially fears the grown-up Drishti and Aditya. But after the assurance of Scienjo that they have grown-up, she still remain hesitant but calms down. As Aditya and Drishti share their motive for entering the forbidden house, Scienjo scolds them for ignoring warnings. He explains the consequences of their actions and urges them to leave. Unbeknownst to them, Scienjo and Naina share a deep connection, with Scienjo acting as Naina's guardian since her parents' demise. Aditya and Drishti return with their own struggles, disclosing their lack of knowledge about the outer world. However, the revelation of a peculiar meteor effect that turns children into adults, leaving their mental state unchanged, sheds light on their predicament. Scienjo, adamant about protecting Naina, insists they leave. Yet, Naina's compassion prevails, and she allows them to stay temporarily. The revelation that Aditya and Drishti were adults all along complicates their plan to steal a rumored rock from under the house. However, the biggest twist surfaces when it's revealed that there is no mystical rock. Scienjo, masquerading as a caretaker, orchestrates a sinister plot involving the disappearance of children and their transformation into adults to facilitate a child trafficking ring. Naina, discovering Scienjo's true nature, confronts him in a battle of wits, ultimately exposing the dark operation and liberating the captive children. As Naina breaks free from her childhood trauma and exposes Scienjo's heinous activities, there is another mystery which is yet to be unfold as Naina gets to know about Scienjo's past and his true self.\n",

      "2024\n",
      "\"Maya-the Truth\" appears to be a compelling and thought-provoking film, delving into the themes of morality, consequences, and the human psyche. The story's focus on the protagonist's journey through his own past misdeeds and the eventual reckoning is a classic narrative about the inevitability of facing the consequences of one's actions. The film's exploration of the idea that \"the past can become the truth of tomorrow\" is particularly intriguing. This suggests a deeper commentary on how our actions, especially those we might want to forget or dismiss, have a way of defining our future. The character of Maya seems to be a catalyst for this revelation, forcing the protagonist, Arjun, to confront the truths he has long evaded. The performances, as described, seem to be particularly noteworthy. Mahi Zaal's portrayal of Maya is highlighted as a standout, suggesting a nuanced and powerful performance. Fahad Asad as Raj and Naina Gill as Khushbu, despite the latter's brief role, also appear to have delivered impactful performances. Director Naha Laj and writer Naeem Tahir seem to have created a film that's not just entertainment but also a medium for delivering a powerful message. The emphasis on the 'sensual animal inside man' and the disregard for the 'sanctity of relationships' points to a critical examination of human behaviour and societal norms.\n",

Abram's path begins with a stark declaration: dragging a coffin through the streets, he proclaims, \"I have killed God!\" This attracts Fitna. His alarm brings media hounds and police, transforming a quiet day into a whirlwind. As chaos unfolds, Abram's past unfolds too. College students hack into his laptop, projecting his private discussions onto a live news channel. This unexpected audience witnesses philosophical debates about existentialism, nihilism, and the very origins of the concept of God. Beyond intellectual discourse, the film delves into humanity's darker side. The conversation shifts to the manipulative use of God's name to justify violence and discrimination based on color, creed, caste, and gender. Abram's act ignites a firestorm. He becomes a symbol, interpreted differently by various factions. Some see him as a Bad Guy, others as a liberator challenging oppressive doctrines. The narrative deftly weaves Abram's philosophical debates with the escalating external conflict. The film builds suspense, leaving the audience to wonder - what is Abram's true motive? Has he truly killed God, or is he a man desperate to awaken the world? \"God Must Die\" is more than just philosophical musings. It's a social commentary, urging viewers to confront the complex realities of faith, prejudice, and the search for meaning in a seemingly godless world. By the time the police raid Abram's home, he has vanished. His absence becomes a powerful statement, leaving the audience with lingering questions and no easy answers. Did he escape? Was he captured? )\n",

Under these circumstances, anyone roaming these hills would tell you the shocking truth: that combat soldiers are statistically safer than women. The calm melody of the idyllic villages is disrupted by the abrasive sputter of semi-automatic gunfire. In one such neighborhood, we see Aasma, a delicate young girl. For Aasma, heaven and hell are about to collide. The leader of the local village conceals four armed militants from across the border, in his house. In due course they notice the young girl. Mesmerized by her delicate beauty and overcome by lust, they kidnap Aasma. Their leader reasons that on their way to a suicidal terrorist attack, this is probably their last opportunity to be with a woman before martyrdom. As Aasmaa's night of torment unfolds, one of the militants, Intekhaab, shows signs of regret; he knows that Islam does not permit cruelty on woman. But in the presence of armed hostility he must find clever ways to delay the inevitable. In the tight, cramped quarters, the odds are stacked against Intekhaab: can he find a way to save Assma - and himself? Can a different face of so-called Islamic terrorism emerge from this desperate plight, so that Aasma is not yet another faceless victim of this endless conflict?\n",

Bishnois are followers of Jambheshwar Maharaj's 29 principles, which emphasize the protection of nature and living beings. They believe that sacrificing one's life to save trees is a noble act, as their guru has said, \"If you have to cut your head to save a tree, it's a cheap deal.\" Girdharlal Bhandari, the king's minister, who harbored a grudge against the Bishnois, led a group of soldiers to the Bishnoi village to cut down trees. However, they faced resistance from the Bishnois. Amrita Devi, a simple and truthful Bishnoi woman, led the resistance, inspiring neighboring villages to join the fight. This incident is an example of extraordinary courage. The axes and swords clashed, and the number of beheaded Bishnois grew. The killers grew tired, but the Bishnois remained steadfast, refusing to let a single tree be cut. This is a unique and unparalleled incident in the history of not only Bharat but the whole of world, inspiring us to protect nature, wildlife, and the environment.\n",

Aarav, the obedient protégé, has become a successful businessman, sharing the reins of the family's construction empire. He's also the perfect fiancé to the fiery NEHA DESHMUKH, daughter of a powerful politician. Their impending marriage is a fusion of friendship and familial expectations, lacking only that elusive spark of passion But fate has other plans. A business trip to the breathtaking valleys of Bhaderwah, Kashmir brings Aarav face-to-face with Khushbu Kaul. She's a whirlwind of contradictions-a free spirit with an old soul, whose laughter echoes through the mountains and whose wisdom seem as ancient as the surrounding peaks. In just three days, Khushbu awakens something in Aarav he never knew existed, challenging the very foundation of his carefully constructed world. For the first time, the man who always followed his head is compelled to listen to his heart, a language he's long forgotten. As Aarav returns to Delhi, he's torn between the life he's always known-the path meticulously laid out by his father-and the possibility of a love he never expected. The countdown to his wedding with Neha begins, but Aarav is a changed man, haunted by memories of Kashmir and a pair of eyes that seem to hold the secrets of the universe. Neha, perceptive and proud, senses the shift in her fiancé. Will she fight for the love she's always believed in, or step aside for a connection that seems written in the stars. Meanwhile, in Jammu, Khushbu grapples with her own dilemma, caught between pursuing this unexpected love and respecting the boundaries of society. As the wedding day approaches, tensions rise. Aarav must navigate the treacherous waters between his father's expectations, his duty to Neha, and the passionate pull of his heart towards Khushbu. Will he bow to the life planned for him, or risk everything for a chance at true love? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
